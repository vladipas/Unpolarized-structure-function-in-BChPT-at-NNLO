Dear Bharathi Sundararajan,

thank you very much for the proofs of our paper DS12760.alarcon! Below, we reply to your questions and ask for a couple of changes. We thank you in advance for your work and kindly ask for a second proof.

Best regards,
Franziska Hagelstein

Reply to specific question 1:
line 306: "HB" -> "heavy-baryon (HB)"

Reply to specific question 5:
The references in Eq. (16) should be: proton [38] and neutron [39]

Reply to specific question 7:
Complete publisher information reads as
IOP Publishing, Bristol, UK and Morgan & Claypool Publishers, San Rafael, CA, USA

Reply to specific question 8:
The following description of the Supplemental Material should be included in Ref. [29], not Ref. [73]

"See Supplemental Material at <link> for the analytic expressions of the considered contributions to the polarizabilities and their slopes at the real-photon point, as well as their HB expansion, provided as a Mathematica 12 notebook."

At the link the Supplemental Material can be described as:

"In the Supplemental Material, we provide the polarizabilities and their slopes at the real-photon point, as well as the heavy-baryon expansions of the pion-nucleon loop, Delta-exchange and pion-Delta loop contributions. The Supplemental Material is given as a Mathematica notebook generated in Mathematica version 12.0.0.0."

Furthermore, we ask for the following small corrections:

- Please remove the email address "vladipas@kph.uni-mainz.de"

- Please include Orcid ID's for J.M.A.: 0000-0002-7764-9823 and V.P.: 0000-0002-2613-6104

- In our submitted manuscript we distinguished the symbols \varDelta and \Delta, these became now the same symbols. This should be corrected. 

- Change title by removing "at NLO"

- line 111: “to the static values and slopes of the polarizabilities and moments of structure functions.” -> “to the central values and slopes of the polarizabilities and moments of structure functions at $Q^2=0$.”

- Eqs. (8a), (8b), (22), (33): introduce a space "\mathrm{d}xx" -> "\mathrm{d}x\,x"

- Eq. (13): insert a space after \delta\beta

- Eq. (14): insert a space before and after \delta\beta

- line 299: “both have the Baldin sum rule as their static limit” -> “both change into the Baldin sum rule in the real-photon limit”

- line 425: "N$^2$LO" -> "next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO)"

- line 428: “static piece $P(0)$” -> “real-photon piece $P(0)$”

- line 516: "static polarizabilities" -> "dipole polarizabilities"

- line 530: “In addition to the static values, we can now investigate the slopes of the polarizabilities at the real-photon point.” -> “In addition, we investigate the slopes of the polarizabilities at the real-photon point.”

- line 589: “For the static values of $\alpha_L$” -> “For $\alpha_L$”

- line 592: “For the slopes at $Q^2=0$” -> “For the slope at $Q^2=0$”

- line 611:
“departs from the static limit” -> “departs from the real-photon limit”

- line 690: After the second sentence, ending with "..parameter-free prediction of B$\chi$PT", add the following
sentence:

"We have provided the theoretical uncertainty of these predictions due to higher-order effects, as well as an explicit illustration  
of such effects due to the inclusion of a low-energy constant from N$^2$LO [$\mathcal{O}(p^4)]$."

Furthermore, in line 690, replace "These amplitudes" by "The obtained VVCS amplitudes"

- line 809:
“In this section, we give analytical expressions for the static values and slopes at $Q^2=0$ of the  polarizabilities and moments of structure functions.” -> “In this section, we give analytical expressions for the polarizabilities and their slopes at $Q^2=0$.”

- line 815: "Supplemented material" -> "Supplemental Material [29]"

- before Eqs. (B1) and (B15): “Static polarizabilities ($Q^2=0$)” -> “Polarizabilities at $Q^2=0$”

- Remove "?" in title of Ref. [4]

- Ref. [64]: The name of the first author is V.~Olmos de Le{\'o}n - please correct it.
