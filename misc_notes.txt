***********
Regarding the referee's general comment on the counting scheme we chose: indeed, the nucleon-Delta mass difference is arguably not much larger than the pion mass. This can naively lead to a slower convergence of the delta-counting compared to, e.g., the epsilon-counting where the said difference is treated as being of the order of the pion mass. Nevertheless, the delta-counting has its advantages especially when one considers energies close to the Delta resonance: this counting leads to a very natural description of the Delta width. Admittedly, this is more important in, e.g. a calculation of real Compton scattering (considered by some of the authors in an earlier work [Lensky and Pascalutsa 2010, Ref. 32], using the same formalism) rather than in the current VVCS setting. However, one of our aims was to achieve the simultaneous description of the different Compton kinematics using the same formalism, hence the natural choice of the counting scheme. 

Points to discuss [remove before finalising the reply]

-> In the delta counting we are at NLO at low Q^2 and have an incomplete LO at Q^2 ~ varDelta or larger. This is something we admitted in the 2017 paper with Marc. However, it looks like we save (or at least improve) the situation by splitting the polarizabilities (where this is relevant) into the static piece and the Q^2-dependent rest. Namely, we can argue that the static piece is NLO, and the rest - which interpolates from NLO to incomplete LO as Q^2 grows - is missing only the Q^2-dependent parts of the piDelta loops with 2 or 3 Deltas to become full LO, but those parts are small (which can arguably be seen from those piDelta loops that we have included; analogy can be drawn to RCS where they have a very weak energy dependence) and therefore their omission shouldn't lead to the predictions failing miserably at larger Q^2. Besides, we have tilde delta(Q^2) that grows with Q^2 and thus accommodates the larger uncertainty at larger Q^2. [By the way, why do we have Q^2/2M_N \varDelta in the definition of tilde delta(Q^2) instead of Q^2/\varDelta^2 which should naively be there? Do we want to explain that?]

We already have statements that argue that piDelta loops are only weakly Q^2-dependent, so we could perhaps change those paragraphs without modifying too much.

-> Regarding the renormalisation procedure: one thing that is maybe not clear enough is that we subtract the Born parts, which is simply in accordance with us taking only the non-Born parts into consideration (with the Born parts calculated, if needed, with phenomenological form factors). We can probably clarify that.

-> Regarding the gauge invariance: shall we include the general statements about the e.m. gauge invariance conflicting with the spin-3/2 gauge invariance? What else can we include there? Shall we state that this gauge invariance issue is indeed due to the counting? Any ideas?
